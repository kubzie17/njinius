Exception handling is a way of handling errors/exception. There are time when we dont want our programe to break or shut down when it runs into certain issues, we want to be ablt to "raise the alarm"
so to speak so the error can be corrected. Sof for this weeks challenge, is to figure out how to handle the error in the code. The source code can be found in the Njinius exeption handling respository via this link.
