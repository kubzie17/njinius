The environment is relaxed, making it easier to be productive and the people are easy-going. I have worked in places where the office environment is quite rigid and tense and being in meetings where instead of finding solutions to problems, the blame is being assigned, and that blame culture leads to low levels of productivity as people wouldn't even take initiatives in fear of being blamed when something goes wrong. When I joined Glasswall, they were under immense pressure to meet the deadline and at no time was the environment hostile or blame being assigned.

There's table tennis available for all to play and have a friendly game just to unwind a bit, there are card games available as well. This I feel facilitates team bonding as well as building that unity so that no groups or team members feeling like outsiders. At times, things can get intense trying to complete tasks, and so there are refreshments available just to help get through those tough periods.\nCommunication with the higher management is quite amazing in this place. The CEO holds weekly update meeting about the dealings of the company, potential contracts, potential changes so everyone is in the loop about what is happening, which I feel motivates people as they have a full image of what is happening. During the extremely busy period trying to meet the deadline, the management were transparent about the situation with the client, making it easier to put in those extra hours because we know the full situation rather than just be told to do those extra hours but then be in total darkness as to why you're doing those hours.\nIn my years as a Project Engineer, I've worked in over eight different offices and none of them come close to being such a non-hostile easy environment. From the perspective of someone who's not only new to the company, but new to the industry as a whole, the working environment allows for growth. The flexibility as well of start and finish times is another plus. There's a window of starting time then can do your eight hours from then, this allows for early starts if you wish for an early finish. So far, I haven't a single complaint this place and I'm quite enjoying life at Glasswall.Blog features are powered by the blog plugin.
