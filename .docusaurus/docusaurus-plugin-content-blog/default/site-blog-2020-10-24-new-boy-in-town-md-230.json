  "description": "In one sentence, life at Glasswall has been great. The environment is relaxed, making it easier to be productive and the people are easy-going. I have worked in places where the office environment is quite rigid and tense and being in meetings where instead of finding solutions to problems, the blame is being assigned, and that blame culture leads to low levels of productivity as people wouldn't even take initiatives in fear of being blamed when something goes wrong. When I joined Glasswall, they were under immense pressure to meet the deadline and at no time was the environment hostile or blame being assigned. This has been by far the best teamwork and collaboration I have seen, I mean the daily stand-ups alone show this. Anyone facing issues can just state that at the stand-up, by time the stand-up is done, there are already volunteers to help out solve that problem.",
